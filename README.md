railroad-network
================

Very simple web tool to visualize the positions of trams on the network of Rouen.

See demo at: http://tram.thomasrobert.fr

It uses PHP with the graph library by clue, and JavaScript with d3.js for the SVG rendering.
PHP dependancy is handled with composer.

Note that this is a quick-and-dirty project. It has been done in a couple of days
just for fun.

I did not left the API URLs in the source code and if you want to use this
code on another network, you will very probably need to adapt how the API results are treated.

If you want to know more, contact me ;)
